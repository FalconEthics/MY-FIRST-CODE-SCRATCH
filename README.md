# MY-FIRST-CODE/SCRATCH
~ Was cleaning my old pc, found my first code ðŸ˜‡

I wouldn't really disagree if you say it's not really code but, ya it is what it is and am really proud of it!

### To run it:
- make account in Scratch: `https://scratch.mit.edu/` 
- it's a fun visual editor for learning programming by MIT, it's one of the  best ways to learn the fundamentals if you'er an absolute beginner and it's your first time seeing code.
- create a new project: `https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/`
- click on the files from the nav bar then load from computer: `BAT BEAR FOX.sb3`
